## [About][about]

Using KNN algorithm to determine if a given input belongs to one of the three classes of Iris family of flowers.

## [Getting Started][getting_started]

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [installing](#installing) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## [Installing][installing]

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

It is always better to have a virtual environment so that you can go ham on your changes and still not end up breaking your system. All the necessary packages required to run this project is provided in the [requirements][/requirements.txt] file.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If this doesn't work, you need to install pip: <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>
The "r" flag is used to install dependencies recursively.

## [Usage][usage]

This is just a visualization of the Iris flowers dataset and has no particular usage as such.

## [Disclaimer][disclaimer]

This is the "Iris" dataset. Originally published at [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set][https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris], this small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations (for example, Scatter Plot). Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.
